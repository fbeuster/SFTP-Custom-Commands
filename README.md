SFTP-Custom-Commands
====================

This á¹•lugin for Sublime Text is written to extend the plugin SFTP. After starting Sublime Text,
SFTP syncs all open files from remote.

As i am working on different systems and SFTP does not provide a shortcut to sync down all files,
i wrote this plugin. It's iterating over all open files in the current window and sync the files
if needed. The default keyboard shortcut for this new command is Ctrl+Alt+4 (or Cmd+Alt+4).
