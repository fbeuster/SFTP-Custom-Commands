SFTP-Custom-Commands
====================

This á¹•lugin for Sublime Text is written to extend the plugin SFTP. After starting Sublime Text,
SFTP syncs all open files from remote.

As i am working on different systems and SFTP does not provide a shortcut to sync down all files,
i wrote this plugin.

It is possible to sync down alle tabs of the current window `Ctrl+Alt+N`. And you can sync down all windows with `Ctrl+Alt+M`
